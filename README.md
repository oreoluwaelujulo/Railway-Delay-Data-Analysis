# Railway-Delay-Data-Analysis
## DISCUSSION

The data is about delay in train departure times for UK train stations. 
The data was collected over four months, January to April 2024 covering 2 seasons Winter and Spring. 

During this time, 1,118 tickets that were bought experienced delay, with 546 or those tickets arriving at their destination and 572 of those tickets being cancelled. Passengers generally seemed more willing to travel in spring compared to winter.

There was more travel during the spring than winter and spring had more successful travel rates. This may not bear real impact and may just be a reflection of the number of tickets purchased.

There were also more trips during the weekdays than weekends indicating that most of the commute could be related to work and commercial activities. 

The rate of success of train travels looks to be directly proportional to the volume of tickets purchased from the train station where the trains departed from. Generally, there is no direct relationship to the reason for delay although aa few stations fall outside this general trend.  

The rates of departure were highest between noon and 4pm. Indicating greater travelling during the hotter periods of the day. Success rate of tickets was considerably higher during the hotter periods of the day. 

The 3 most frequent reasons recorded for delays are technical issues, signal failures and staffing. Again, this could point to the weather. The cold could be affecting the equipment, this covers train and station equipment and the availability of staff. Overall, there appears to be less issues during Spring than in Winter but that might just be due to less tickets being bought during winter.

## INSIGHT & RECOMMENDATION
From the data, I can conclude that weather is a big reason lesser travel and of course for delays at these train stations. Another likely indicated reason is the route of travel.  I recommend more data to help gain better insight into the reasons for the delays the trains currently experience.
